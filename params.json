{"name":"L2bot","tagline":"Simple and easy configurable Lineage 2 bot on AutoIt scripting language","body":"L2Bot 2.5 version\r\n=================\r\n\r\n1. INTRODUCTION\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nL2Bot is toolkit of AutoIt scripts to implement Lineage 2 bot.\r\n\r\n2. INSTALLATION\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nTo launch L2Bot you need to download AutoIt interpreter from official website:\r\nhttp://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads\r\n\r\nThe x64 interpreter version must be selected in installation dialog for users with x64 Windows version.\r\n\r\nThen download archive with L2Bot scripts and extract it:\r\nhttps://github.com/ellysh/l2bot/archive/master.zip\r\n\r\n3. CONFIGURATION\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nNB: You must set the `chat with Enter` checkbox in your Lineage client application for the correct bot's working.\r\n\r\nConfiguration of the L2Bot consist of the three stages:\r\n1. Configuration of the bot according to your Lineage client's interface.\r\n2. Configuration of the mob's names to attack them by bot.\r\n3. Configuration of the hotbar keys according your character's class.\r\n\r\nAll these stages will be described below.\r\n\r\n3.1 INTERFACE CONFIGURATION\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nYou can use the `configurator_en.au3` script from the `run` directory to configure farm bot according your Lineage client's interface. All interface's parameters will be saved in `interface.au3` file from the `conf` directory.\r\n\r\nThere are steps to perform the interface configuration:\r\n1. Run your Lineage client in the window mode. You can press Alt+Enter for switching to the window mode.\r\n2. Resize the Lineage client window to full screen with mouse.\r\n3. Get into the game with your character.\r\n4. Run `configurator_en.au3` script from the `run` directory.\r\n5. Switch to the Lineage client window.\r\n6. Press Alt+F2 to start configuration script.\r\n7. Select the point in the Lineage window according the information in popup tip. You can select point at the current cursor's position by pressing Alt+F3.\r\n8. The popup tips will be disappeared after you has selected the last point. Configuration is complete.\r\n\r\nThis is illustartion of all configuration points in the `interface_conf.jpg` file from the `images` directory.\r\n\r\nYou can use the `configurator_fishing_en.au3` script from the `run` directory to configure fishing bot. This script works like the described above `configurator_en.au3` one. This is illustration of all configuration points for fishing bot in the `fishing_conf.jpg` file from the `images` directory.\r\n\r\n3.2 MOB'S NAMES CONFIGURATION\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nThere are steps to perform the mob's names configuration:\r\n1. Open the `targets.au3` fle from the `conf` directory with any text editor.\r\n2. Write mob's names into `$kTargetNames` list.\r\n3. Change value of the `$kTargetCount` variable according count of elements in the `$kTargetNames` list.\r\n\r\nNB: You can specify one or two letters of the mob's names for the Gracia Final and above Lineage chronicles. This is example:\r\n\tglobal const $kTargetCount = 2\r\n\tglobal const $kTargetNames[$kTargetCount] = [ \"G\", \"Wo\" ]\r\n\r\nYou must specify full mob's names for Lineage chronicles below the Gracia Final one:\r\n\tglobal const $kTargetCount = 2\r\n\tglobal const $kTargetNames[$kTargetCount] = [ \"Gremlin\", \"Wolf\" ]\r\n\r\n3.3 HOTBAR KEYS CONFIGURATION\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nThe L2Bot scripts implement the farm bots for several character's classes. All these scripts are placed to the `run` directory. Script's name is the same as relevant class's name.\r\n\r\nThe hotbar configuration is depended on the running script. You can use hotbar illustrations from the `images` directory. Name of the illustration file contains the character's class name and the `hotbar` word. For example, `bladedancer_hotbar.jpg` file is the illustration for `bladedancer.au3` script.\r\n\r\nThe `fishing_hotbar.jpg` file from the `images` directory is a hotbar illustration for the fishing bot.\r\n\r\n4. LAUNCHING\r\n------------\r\n\r\nNB: Bots of L2Bot project is not executable `exe` files! All bots are implemented as AutoIt scripts with `au3` extention and them are placed to the `run` directory. You can run these scripts like the `exe` files.\r\n\r\nThere are steps to run L2Bot:\r\n1. Run your Lineage client in the window mode. You can press Alt+Enter for switching to the window mode.\r\n2. Resize the Lineage client window to full screen with mouse.\r\n3. Get into the game with your character.\r\n4. Run one of the farm-bot script from the `run` directory.\r\n5. Switch to the Lineage client window.\r\n6. Press Alt+F2 to start bot.\r\n7. You can stop bot by Alt+F1 pressing.\r\n\r\nNB: The Lineage client window must have the same size and position as you have configured (see the 3.1 section).\r\n\r\n5. FISHING BOT\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nFishing bot is implemented in the runnable `fishing.au3` script file from `run` directory.\r\n\r\nConfiguration of the fishing bot consist of the two stages:\r\n1. Configuration of the bot according to your Lineage client's interface (see the 3.1 section).\r\n2. Configuration of the hotbar keys (see the 3.3 section).\r\n\r\nNB: You must set the attack skill to F1 key for the nuker classes instead the `Attack` action\r\n\r\nYou must perform these actions before run the fishing bot:\r\n1. Place your character near the water where you can use `Fishing` skill. Character and camera must be faced to the water i.e. the character will move to the water if you will press the `Up` arrow keyboard button.\r\n2. Wear the fishrod and bait on your character.\r\n\r\nYou can run and stop fishing bot with the same buttons as the others bots.\r\n\r\n6. CHAT BOT\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nChat bot is implemented in the runnable `chat.au3` script file from the `run` directory.\r\n\r\nYou can open the `chat.au3` file from the `run` directory and specify variables described below to configure bot:\r\n\tkMessageTextRus - this is message text to print in Russian language.\r\n\tkMessageTextEn - this is message text to print in English language.\r\n\tkDelayMinutes - this is delay betweeen the message outputs in minutes.\r\n\r\nYou can run and stop chat bot with the same buttons as the others bots.\r\n\r\n7. CUSTOM SCRIPT\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nThe custom script mechanism allow you to extend the functionality of existing farm bots. Also you can create custom script that will be launched separately from the other L2Bot scripts.\r\n\r\nThere are steps to perform the custom script generation:\r\n1. Run `script_generator.au3` file from the `run` directory.\r\n2. Press Alt+F2 to start generator script.\r\n3. Perform the keys pressing and mouse clicks that will be saved.\r\n4. Press Alt+F1 to complete the generator script\r\n\r\nNB: The generator script is able to save letters, numbers, F1-F12 buttons and left button mouse clicks. The buttons Alt, Ctrl, Shift and Win will not be saved.\r\n\r\nThe generated custom script has been saved in the `script.au3` file in the `run` directory.\r\n\r\nThere are steps to launch custom script:\r\n1. Run `script_run.au3` file from the `run` directory.\r\n2. Press Alt+F2 to start custom script.\r\n3. You can interrupt the custom script's work by Alt+F1 pressing\r\n\r\nNB: You can launch custom script in the loop. Change the `kIsLoop` variable to `true` in the `script_run.au3` file:\r\nglobal const $kIsLoop = true\r\n\r\nAll farm bots will launch custom script by timeout. You can change timeout value with the `kScriptTimeout` variable in the running farm bot script.\r\n\r\n8. REPEATER SCRIPT\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nRepeater script translates player's key pressing to all Lineage 2 window. Additional configuration is not needed for this script.\r\n\r\nThere are steps to launch repeater script:\r\n1. Run `repeater.au3` file from the `run` directory.\r\n2. Switch to the Lineage client window.\r\n3. Press Alt+F2 to start repeater.\r\n4. You can interrupt the script's work by Alt+F1 pressing\r\n\r\n9. ROULETTE BOT\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nRoullete bot allow you to automate roulette play at the asterios.tm servers x3 and x7.\r\n\r\nThere are steps to perform the bot's configuration:\r\n1. Run `configurator_roulette.au3` script from the `run` directory.\r\n2. Switch to the Lineage client window.\r\n3. Press Alt+F2 to start configuration script.\r\n4. Select the point in the Lineage window according the information in popup tip. You can select point at the current cursor's position by pressing Alt+F3.\r\n5. The popup tips will be disappeared after you has selected the last point. Configuration is complete.\r\n\r\nYou can open the `roulette.au3` file from the `run` directory and specify variables described below for additional bot's configuration:\r\n\tkStartRate - start rate.\r\n\tkMaxRate - maximum allowable rate.\r\n\r\nThere are steps to launch rullete bot:\r\n1.
